# HTTP Ingest Source

This source application is an extension of out-of-the-box HTTP source application.

The `http-ingest` has a function bean definition that looks like:

```
@Bean
public Function<String, Long> sendAsUserClicks() {
  return value -> Long.parseLong(value);
}

```

When this function bean is enabled, the incoming `String` value is converted to `Long` value.
When sending user clicks count as `Long` we can enable this function for the `http-ingest` while the same application can be used for sending the user region `String` value.

To build this application:

./mvnw clean package
